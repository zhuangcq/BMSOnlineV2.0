## About BMSonline V2.0: 


BMSonline is developed as a learning tool, which simulates a living environment of VAV air conditioning and online building management system. A multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system and its local and supervisory control strategies are simulated. The simulation is conducted on personal computers with real time or accelerated speed. A window based graphic interface is developed to facilitate the online dialogue between the user and the online Building Management System. The users can tune the local and supervisory control loops, change the set-points of control loops and modify the choice of supervisory strategies online. This provides an online environment for the users to study the effects of the control settings and the strategies on the control dynamics as well as on the energy and indoor environment performances of the air-conditioning system.  

A modern Building Management System integrated with an air-conditioning system is a large-scale dynamic system. Online experiment or test is the best way to learn the BMS operational characteristics, air-conditioning system dynamics and their inter-reaction. Practices show that the lack of knowledge and experience on BMS and self-confidence of the users as well as the designers is one of the key issues affecting the successful application of BMS and acceptance of BMS in the profession. However, due to practical limitations and constraints, the real system and working conditioning may not be available in many cases of learning and training, and may not be the typical cases that are good for learning purposes. 

Therefore, the software package, BMSonline, has been developed to provide a convenient tool for the self-training and learning on the operational performance of DDC control, BMS strategies and dynamic performance of HVAC system under the control of BMS. The tuning of control loops and changes on the set points or supervisor strategies are made on-line by the users through the user interface. The instantaneous responses of the system are presented on various windows on the computer. The control strategy of the VAV system included in the software are the AHU temperature control, pressure control, exfiltration control, outdoor air flow control, pressure independent VAV and zone temperature control, occupancy detection and enthalpy based demanded ventilation control, static pressure set-point reset and AHU temperature set-point reset. 

BMSonline includes the visual tool for the users to conveniently assess and monitor the online operation of BMS control and air-conditioning system. Users can get the experience on the tuning of the local loop controllers, the operation of the supervisory control strategies, the air-conditioning system dynamics, the effects of the control settings and strategies on the system performance by playing window based software on the computer. Such that the users can get the “real” experience of operating the Building Management Systems in a “safe and relax” environment.
