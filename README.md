## About BMSonline V2.0: 


BMSonline V2.0 is a newly developed and improved version of BMSonline, incorporating the latest advancements in building management and control systems, including the use of digital twins technology. The simulation tool provides a virtual replica of a real-life building management and air-conditioning system and is designed to simulate a VAV air-conditioning system and online building management system. The multi-zone VAV air-conditioning system and its control strategies (local and supervisory) can be run on personal computers in real-time or accelerated speed.

The software features a graphic interface for real-time interaction between the user and the building management system, allowing users to tune control loops, change set-points, and modify control strategies. The online environment provides a platform for users to study the impact of these modifications on control dynamics, energy efficiency, and indoor environment.

Due to practical limitations and constraints, real systems may not be available or suitable for learning purposes. BMSonline V2.0 was created as a solution to these challenges, offering a convenient tool for self-training and learning about BMS control, air-conditioning dynamics, and control strategies. The real-time responses of the system are displayed on computer windows, providing users with a "real" experience of operating a building management system in a safe and relaxed environment. The software includes visual tools for monitoring and assessing the online operation of BMS control and air-conditioning systems, including control strategies such as AHU temperature control, pressure control, exfiltration control, outdoor air flow control, pressure-independent VAV, zone temperature control, occupancy detection, enthalpy-based demanded ventilation control, static pressure set-point reset, and AHU temperature set-point reset.
